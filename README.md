# DeepFlap

Deep Q Learning approach to play Flappy Bird.

Built heavily on @zamlz's [Rubix Cube solver](https://github.com/zamlz/cube-net-rl) (agent.py is mostly the same), uses pygame-based [FlapPyBird](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird) to emulate game

Usage:
```bash
# Training
./agent.py

# Evaluating (must train first)
./agent.py --evaluate
```
